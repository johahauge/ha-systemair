## Requirements
- Home Assistant
- Systemair model that supports modbus communication. You might need to replace the motherboard with the newer PCU-EC4
- A device to send Modbus as TCP connected to the motherboard

## Implementing
Copy the content or files to your Home Assistant installation in the config directory. You can include the content directly into the configuration.yaml file, but that will be messy.

Not all registers are included. Please reference the Systemair modbus PDF for more information and registers. 
You might have to do some manual editing to make it work with your setup.
